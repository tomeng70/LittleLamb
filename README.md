# The Exponential Growth Problem
Imagine you had a colony of bacteria that lives in an ideal environment.  In this ideal environment, the bacteria have virtually unlimited food and space to grow.

In this scenario, the rate at which the quantity of bacteria or its population size changes is proportional to the size of the population itself.
The more bacteria you have, the faster the population will grow in size.

This rate equation can be expressed as follows,

$\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$
